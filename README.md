# hello-world
it's a repository to learn how GitHub function
## Steps
I have learned how to use Command Line of git locally.<br />

##Email
SaadMosallam@git.com

## Remote Work
Having a github UI for adding new commits, we can do our fixes on the fly now. This is awesome!

## warning
We intend to learn and grow using git together :)

## issue 53
This important issue should be fixed by removing this nonsense warning. The warning should be more polite.

## Saturday Feature
This is a new feature that should be added to the project. It should be added to the project as soon as possible.
We all need to start celebrating Saturday as a holiday.
## issue 55
The user is trying to change his preassigned username. This should be only allowed through specific UI.
With our supervision, we will not have conflicting names.
